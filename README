=About
This is the rBroccoli extension for ruby which provides access to the 
Broccoli API.  Broccoli is a library for communicating with the Bro Intrusion
Detection System.  Broccoli is distributed with Bro now, so I'm going to be
releasing versions of rBroccoli that target Bro versions.

=Install
To install the extension
1. Make sure that the broccoli-config binary is in your path.
     (export PATH=/usr/local/bro/bin:$PATH)
2. Run, "sudo ruby setup.rb"

To install the extension as a gem (<b>suggested</b>)
1. Install rubygems... http://rubygems.org/
2. Make sure that the broccoli-config binary is in your path. 
     (export PATH=/usr/local/bro/bin:$PATH)
3. Run, "sudo gem install rbroccoli" 

=Usage
There aren't really any useful docs yet.  Your best bet currently is
to to read through the examples.

One thing I should mention however is that I haven't done any optimization
yet.  You may find that if you write code that is going to be sending or
receiving extremely large numbers of events, that it won't run fast enough and 
will begin to fall behind the Bro server.  The dns_requests.rb example is
a good performance test if your Bro server is sitting on a network with many
dns lookups.
